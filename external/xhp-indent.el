;;; xhp-indent.el --- indent xhp code according to facebook style
;;; Copyright (C) 2012 Facebook Inc.
;;; Author: Aaron Brady <abrady0@fb.com>
;;; Usage:
;;   when coding TAB should indent a line of php or xhp according to
;;   style consistent with facebook style guidelines.
;;
;;   certain characters (semicolon, paren, etc.) will also
;;   automatically cause indentation
;;
;;   also of note is xhp-fill-paragraph, bound to ESC-q by default,
;;   that will break strings, xhp, functions with lots of params into
;;   multiple, properly indented lines
;;
;;   to enable this customize xhp-mode-use-xhp-indent-p to t and make
;;    sure your php files load in xhp mode.
;;
;; Also: you can always use
;; $ cmf --indent_php <file> to have your php indented properly
